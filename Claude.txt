Please implemen the Process() method as a c# script for unity with OpenCVForUnity (1st atttached). 
(note:  Please.)

BACKGROUND

This script performs preprocessing steps for the Optical Flow algorithm, including color isolation, 
face mesh detection, and optical flow computation. It also provides a GUI for configuring various 
parameters using PyQt5.

This is for developing an image-processing flow, to be used for open/closed/blink detection in a Unity-engine game.
The image processing flow that results from developments here will be implemented in Unity using OpenCVForUnity.

APPROACH / DESIGN

The `process` function is responsible for processing a given frame to isolate a specific color and remove non-colors.  It performs several preprocessing steps, including downscaling, Gaussian blurring, HSV conversion, median blurring,  dilation, and bitwise operations to achieve the desired output. 

Additionally, it integrates with the Mediapipe Face  Mesh to obtain eye bounds and applies Optical Flow (OF) computation at different stages of the processing pipeline. - frame (numpy.ndarray): The input frame to be processed.
